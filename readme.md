### Improvments for the data analysis process. 

* Better visualisation for distance and duration of travel - Possibly Box Plot for both elements. 

* Double check duration calculation. 

* Further breaking down visualation into members vs casual types. For example, Maps could separate Members/Casual destinations.

* Futher Cleaning of longitude and latitude coordinates.

* Further Cleaning of Station names or look into using Station ID instead.
