# Citi Bike Analysis in New Jersey 

## Story Analysis 

#### Part 1: Identifying the Most popular starting station 
Using the bar chart, we can clearly identify the most used bike station for starting a journey in New Jersey In Novemember. The top being Hoboken Terminal - River St & Hudson Pl, followed by Grove St Path and then again Hoboken Terminal - Hudson St & Hudson Pl, in the month of Novemeber. 

#### Part 2: Visualising the end jounrey destination.
Using the map feature we can identify where the starting bike station is located in New Jersey and pinpoint that Hoboken is natural gathering spot of travellers as it a train station. 

Taking a look at the end destination we see that the marjority of the end destination are in the northern suburbs with still a few riders heading into the southern suburbs. With the 3 main spots being Stevens - River Ter & 6 St, 8 St & Washington St & 12 St & Sinatra.

### Part 3: Looking at usage throughout the day for one destination
Specifically looking into the journeys that started at Hoboken Terminal - River St & Hudson Pl and ended at Stevens - River Ter & 6 St.  

##### Monday - Friday
We can first see a high amount of riders during 7:00am - 11:00am during the weekdays, which may be due to the individuals in the workforce using these bikes to get to work as the next peak of riders happen at 6:00pm which would relate as marjority of individuals would have a 9-5 work schedual. 

The average distance travelled by members is quite consistent, which indicate marjority of riders are using these bikes to simply reach their destination with no marjor detours. This could be an area of improvement for the company to look into (See Improvements for the company). 

Timewise, members that begin thier journey at 7 take the longest with a time of 0.3 hours (18 minutes) followed by at 17:00 with 0.2 hours (12 minutes). Casual members duration peak at 0.5 hours (30 minutes) and 1.0 hours (60 minutes), this may be linked to casual members not ending their trip once reaching their destination. 

##### Saturday - Sunday 
Bike usage drops significantly during the weekend for both members and casuals, with peak hours at 4:00pm with a total of 3 hours across the month of Novemember. 

Average distance travel remains consistent and duration for travel peaks at 11:00am for casual riders and 3:00pm for members.  

### Improvement ideas for the company 
To improve riders counts during downtime, prehaps the company could look into further developing a fun aspect for usage of these bikes. Inital thoughts could be creating routes which individuals could look up in the app to explore the city, could include toursit spots, recommened restaurants near bike stations, interesting events destinations, a stamp collection at each station, etc. 

## General analysis 

Taking a look into the counts of rider, distance travelled and duration of travel during a 3 month period between Octber - Decemeber. 

We see a peak of usage for members happen at 12:00pm, with a count of 3,254, followed by a peak at 4:00pm at 3,058. This is identical with the casual peak hours but at a lower counts of 1,464 and 1402 respectively. 

Casual members are more likely to travel for longer distances and longer periods. This difference could be further investigated with more data but without it, only assumption can be made about the reasoning. 

Considering members would ideally be more consistent with usage, they should be making regular trips to the same destination which would generate a more consistent journey compared to casual riders. Casual member could be using the bikes for a more explorative journey rather than to reach a destination in the shortest route. 


## Appendix 

### Improvments for the data analysis process. 

* Better visualisation for distance and duration of travel - Possibly Box Plot for both elements. 

* Double check duration calculation. 

* Further breaking down visualation into members vs casual types. For example, Maps could separate Members/Casual destinations.

* Futher Cleaning of longitude and latitude coordinates.

* Further Cleaning of Station names or look into using Station ID instead.
